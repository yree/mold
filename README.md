## Usage

### Setup
- Create a GitHub pages repo, see [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
- Add a `_config.yml` file (or copy the one from this repo), and insert below line:
    ```yaml
    remote-theme: yree/mold
    ``` 
- See site settings to further customize the theme.

### Organization
- The theme operates on the WYWIWYS (wee-wee-wiz) principle.
- The `README.md` at the repo root acts as the index for the GitHub Page.
- To create more posts add `.md` files and folders to your repo.
- Link these `.md` files across each other (refer to this repo structure).

### Pro Tips

#### Site Settings
- Customize your blog further by editing the `_config.yml` file.
- Adjust the blog's name, author, theme appearance, date formatting, and more.
- The file includes comments to guide you through each customizable field.

#### Dark Mode for Images
- The theme's dark mode is achieved through CSS `invert()` function.
- Images aren't inverted by default to maintain expected appearance.
- Apply `class="ioda"` to specific images to force color inversion.

## Development
- Run `bundle install` to set up your environment.
- Start the server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
- Modify your theme and content as needed, preview your theme at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
- Only specific files and directories are bundled. Adjust `mold.gemspec` to include custom directories if necessary.
